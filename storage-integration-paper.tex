\begin{abstract}
The inherent limitation of blockchain technology for storing bulky and often confidential information such as files and images is a major obstacle for the technology's adoption as a platform for real-world applications that would otherwise be greatly benefited from the technology's other offerings. As an alternative, this paper presents a novel solution for reliable and secure integration of external document storage systems such as storage clouds and data centers with a blockchain network. In this approach, each document in the external storage is tagged with some blockchain smart contract that governs user access. Consequently, the responsibility of document access control, access fee processing, integrity insurance, and user authentication remains in the hands of the blockchain network and external storage systems focus only on storing and delivering documents efficiently. The solution's reliance on the blockchain technology for various control operations related to document access means greater trust and security for these operations. At the same time, this responsibility breakdown simplifies external document storage systems' design.

\section{Document Access Permission Control}
\label{s-accr}
The upload/download protocols of previous section do not launch until the gateway verifies that the requesting user has the proper permissions for accessing the external storage. There are two facets of the access permission verification problem. First, there must be a generic configuration mechanism for encoding the access control policy for associating and accessing external documents with the blockchain smart contracts of an application. Second, there must be an inviolable mechanism for enforcing the said access control policy in the storage integration gateway. Before we discuss these facets, we share our vision about the organization and relationship of the smart contracts of a blockchain application that set the requirements for document access control policy configuration.

\subsection{Blockchain Application Organization}
In our modeling, the smart contracts of a blockchain application form one or more rooted relationship hierarchies. The contracts deployed in the blockchain all come from a set of predefined contract templates and each deployed contract bears an application identifier and a type identifier that relate them to the owning application and the type template respectively.

For example, consider a blockchain application for crowd-funded real-estate assets development. The investors will receive ownership rights on parts of the asset. The asset developer will receive the profit for asset development. The actual development work will be conducted through a series of activities assigned to sub-contractors. In addition, some regulatory agency will be tagged with each asset development project by the local branch of the ministry of land for overseeing purposes. Finally, an investor can trade his/her share on the asset for profit. A probable contract template relationship hierarchy for this description can be as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig-2}. It is apparent from the description that the root of the relationship in this case is the {\it Project} contract.
\begin{figure}[h]
\label{fig-2}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{access-req-example}                    
\caption{An example smart contract relationship hierarchy}
\end{figure}

Each contract in the hierarchy may have provision for associating external documents with it. Some of these documents will be public, i.e., accessible to any user upon submission of proper payment. For example, any would-be investor should be able to view documents related to project plan, and the profile of the asset developer and the regulatory agency to make an informed investment decision. Hence these documents should be public. Other documents will be protected and only accessible to users who are somehow related to the smart contracts associated with the documents through the rooted contract relationship hierarchy. For example, once a user invests on a project, he/she will own an investment contract. Only then he/she can access the profile related documents of all the sub-contractors who carry the string of of activities for that asset development project and any descriptive documents associated with those activities. However, he/she should not be able to view documents related to the payment negotiated between an assigner of activity and the assignee. Only the involved parties should see these documents. A regulatory agency representative should be able to view all documents associated with the project for proper supervision.    

For associating a document with a smart contract, i.e. document upload, the user must have direct access to the smart contract. For example, only the {\it owner} of an asset developer profile contract should be able to upload profile related documents and link them with his/her contract. He/she should be able to link new documents with a project contract only if he/she is the {\it creator} of the project. Meanwhile, both the {\it assigner} of a development activity and the {\it assignee} can link new documents with the activity. Hence, although in all cases a user must have direct association with the underlying smart contracts, the specific attribute of a contract that relates the user to it naturally varies.   

The expectation is that the access control policy configuration mechanism can encode all the various restrictions for document upload and download. Furthermore, the configuration mechanism must be generic as the storage integration gateway is not application specific and may be catering to the needs of multiple blockchain applications simultaneously. In other words, the gateway should not understand attributes such as {\it owner, creator,} and {assigner}; rather, it should interpret a common format of access control policy configuration and apply any configuration blindly.      
 
\subsection{Access Control Policy Configuration}
Our solution for generic specification of access control policies of various blockchain applications is to provide a simple language for expressing how a document bearer contract and the users allowed to access the document are related through the root of a contract relationship hierarchy. There are three components of each permission expression that grants a specific kind of users an specific kind of access to a specific document of a specific type of smart contract:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Source Linkage: a path description that tells how the root of the contract relationship hierarchy can be reached from the document bearer contract.
\item Accessor Linkage: another path description that tells how the root of the contract relationship hierarchy can be reached from the contract holding a reference of the user address.
\item Path Intersection Requirement: a specification that tells to what extend the source and accessor linkages should overlap to grant the user access to the document.     
\end{enumerate}

\caption{Permission Expression Grammar}
\label{grammar}
\end{figure*}

Figure~\ref{grammar} describes the grammar for permission policy configuration for a document bearer smart contract. The grammar requires that access permissions are specified per document type and individually for each approved user category. For example, assume in the contract relationship hierarchy of Figure~\ref{fig-2}, the {\it investor} of any {\it Investment} contract, the {\it assigner} of an ancestor {\it DevActivity} contract, and any of the {\it representatives} of the {\it RegulatoryAgency} contract can view the {\it license} document of the {\it Subcontractor} contract corresponding to the {\it assignee} of a {\it DevActivity} of the underlying project. Meanwhile, only the {\it owner} of the {Subcontractor} contract can both read and replace (i.e., write) the {\it license} document in the external storage. Then the permission configuration for the {\it license} document should be as described in Listing~\ref{perm-ex}:

\lstset{caption=Example access permission configuration, label=perm-ex}
\lstinputlisting{permission-example.txt}

All permission expressions related to the documents of a document bearer contract will be static properties of the contract to make them retrievable in the storage integration gateway from the contract template specification. In addition, contracts are required to emit properly formatted events\footnote{An event should contain the addresses of the two contracts whose direct association has been affected by the blockchain transaction, their template type names, and the nature of the update.} on the blockchain audit log in response to blockchain transactions that may affect source or accessor linkages of various documents.
